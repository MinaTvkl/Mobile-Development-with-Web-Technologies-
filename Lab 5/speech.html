George: The sea was angry that day my friends, like an old man trying to return soup at a deli George: I got about fifty-feet out and then suddenly the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he gave out a big bellow. I said, Easy big fella! And then as I watched him struggling I realized something was obstructing his breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish! Jerry: Mammal. George: Whatever. Kramer: Well, what did you do next? George: Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed like a cork and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction! Kramer: What is that a Titleist? A hole in one eh. Jerry: Well the crowd most have gone wild!")'> Speak!</button>
